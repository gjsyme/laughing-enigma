Very basic script that will pull each DOODLE token based upon their baseURI (by observation) and print it to the command line.
Unsure of any rate limiting concern, but it was able to run for the first thousand (see first_thousand.txt)

To make it run against the full 10000, change out the commented MAX_TOKENS valueat line 1.

This was built/run using yarn, so install dependencies with `yarn` and then you'll be able to run the script using `node index.js`
